To (re)compile:

  flatc -r -b file_spec.fbs && mv file_spec_generated.rs ../src/escp/file_spec.rs

flatc is very sensitive to the version of flatbuffers used (See Readme.md)
You may need to manually compile flatc from:

/*

How we handle placing files on the remote system:

By default all files specified end up at the root directory of target system:

for instance in escp foo/bar/blah /tmp/baz/blob host:target

on host, the resultant tree would be target/{blah, blob}

The exception is for directories, where we retain the directory structure; for
instance if you specify escp recursive_dir host: and recursive_dir contains
1/foo and 2/bar. The resultant host would contain 1/foo and 2/bar;

Symlinks are a contentious issue; Time permitting we will do the right thing,
but right now they are probably just ignored. Eventually, we will add
a second 'links: [Link]' structure, which will be populated with symlinks
assuming the user specified the correct flags.
