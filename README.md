EScp 0.9
========

EScp is an application for high speed data transfer. This version has been
tested across the WAN at ~200 gbit/s at SC23, disk-to-disk, limited by NIC.
EScp's command line interface is derived from [SCP](https://openssh.com) and
then extended to provide additional functionality. Some of the features of
EScp include:

  * Multiple TCP/IP streams per transfer ( 1/thread )
  * Lockless multi threaded application
  * ZeroCopy (When blocksize < L3), uses shared memory, and page aligned
  * AES-GCM 128 over the wire encryption, optimized for performance
  * Authentication to remote systems through SSH
  * Swappable I/O Engines ( Currently: DUMMY & POSIX )
  * Block based interface to transferring data
  * Compression (using zstd)
  * Checksums, Direct I/O, API's
  * Memory/Block Based Transfers (as well as File based transfers)

In general, the approach taken by EScp is to have algorithms optimized to give
good performance while providing full-set functionality. This means baseline
security (AES-GCM 128 Encryption, SSH Authorization) and File Reliability
(Checksumming, File Verification, and Transfer Reliability) that scale with
core-count. Additional functionality is available through API's, CLI options,
and so on.

EScp is currently only available for x86-64 on Linux. If you would like to see
*Platform* supported, please open a ticket at https://github.com/ESnet/EScp.

RELEASE NOTES
=============

**EScp is in active development**. The latest tagged releases likely offers the
best stability. Currently that is 0.8.1.

At this point, most scp flags are supported although not necessarily 1:1. EScp
adds additional flags to support high performance transfer flows.

Installation
============

```
# Ubuntu
apt install cmake libtool g++ nasm autoconf automake rustup
git checkout 0.8.1
cargo install cargo-deb
cargo deb
sudo dpkg -i target/debian/escp_0.8.1-1_amd64.deb

# Uninstall
# dpkg -r escp
```

      --blocksize <BLOCK_SZ>             [default: 1M]
      --ioengine <IO_ENGINE>             posix,dummy [default: posix]
  -t, --parallel <THREADS>               # of IO worker threads [default: 4]
      --bits                             Display speed in bits/s
      --nodirect                         Disable direct (O_DIRECT) mode
      --nochecksum                       disable checksum
  -A, --agent                            Enable SSH Agent Forwarding
  -c, --cipher <CIPHER>                  CIPHER used by SSH

  -F, --ssh_config <SSH_CONFIG>          SSH_CONFIG passed to SSH [default: ]
  -J, --jump_host <JUMP_HOST>            JUMP_HOST used by SSH [default: ]
  -L, --license                          Display License
  -h, --help                             Print help
  -V, --version                          Print version

Example:

# Transfer file1 and file2 to server host using SSH
escp file1 file2 host:/remoteDirectory


```

Notes:

**filelist** option expects either a file containing newline seperated
strings or YAML. The YAML option allows specifying source/dest pairs,
as an example:

```
  - [ "SRC_A", "DST_A" ]
  - [ "SRC_B", "DST_B" ]
```

** compress ** is using zstd at compression level 3. If a block of data
fails to compress, compression is skipped for that block.

** preserve ** only applies to files at present. This should be fixed in
a later release.
