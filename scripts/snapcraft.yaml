description: |
  EScp is an in development transfer tool that has a similar syntax to scp, but
  has better performance and offers additional functionality.  EScp uses SSH for
  authentication but data transfer defaults to port 1232 using AES128-GCM. EScp
  has been shown to transfer across the WAN at 200gbit/s, limited only by the
  interface speed.

  EScp is an acronym for "Energy Sciences Transfer Tool" and was created as a
  side project by Charles Shiflett at ESnet. ESnet (https://es.net) is apart of
  the US Department of Energy. More information and the source code for EScp is
  available at https://github.com.
